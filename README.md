System Description: The Complaint/Feedback System with Sentiment Analysis is a web-based platform that allows users to submit feedback or complaints online. It automatically analyzes the sentiment of each message—whether urgent, not important, or neutral—using basic Natural Language Processing. Users can manage their feedback and update their profiles, while administrators can view, manage, and monitor feedback entries. The system is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP, and MySQL.
